## Intro

**Elite software teams deploy code 2,555 times faster and recover from failures 2,604 times quicker than their low-performing counterparts.** This isn't hyperbole—it's hard science from the most rigorous study ever conducted on software delivery performance.

This presentation reveals breakthrough findings from "Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim—the **Shingo Institute Publication Award winner** and the research foundation behind Google's DORA program. What makes this study unprecedented is its scope and scientific rigor: **six years of data collection**, **32,000+ technology professionals surveyed**, and **23,000+ data points** analyzed across every industry and organization size—from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, non-profits to government agencies.

**The stakes couldn't be higher.** Organizations that fail to adopt these practices don't just underperform—they face **46x slower deployment cycles**, **dramatically higher failure rates**, and **significantly higher employee turnover**. Meanwhile, elite performers are **2x more likely to exceed their profitability goals** and dominate their markets.

**The revolutionary insight that changes everything:** There is no trade-off between speed and stability. Elite teams achieve both simultaneously, shattering the false choice that has held back the software industry for decades.

> Organizations often assume they must choose between speed and quality. Research proves this is a false dichotomy - elite teams excel at both simultaneously.

## The Four Metrics

The research identified four key metrics that reliably predict organizational performance:

- **Lead Time for Changes**: Measures the speed from code commit to production deployment
- **Deployment Frequency**: Tracks how often your team releases code to production  
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Captures how quickly you restore service after incidents
- **Change Failure Rate**: Indicates the quality and stability of your deployments. Change failures include deployments that require hotfixes, rollbacks, or patches to fix issues in production.

These four metrics work together to drive both software delivery performance and broader organizational outcomes, creating a cascade effect from technical practices to business results and team well-being.

    F --> J[Customer Satisfaction]
    
    G --> K[Reduced Burnout]
    G --> L[Higher Job Satisfaction]
</div>

The research establishes clear performance benchmarks across four tiers, from elite performers achieving sub-hour lead times and multiple daily deployments to low performers operating on monthly cycles.

| **DORA Delivery Metric** | **Elite**                                | **High**                               | **Medium**                                     | **Low**                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Deployment Frequency**<br>The cadence of code deployment | **On-demand** (multiple deploys per day) | Between once per day and once per week | Between once per month and once every 6 months | Fewer than once per 6 months |
| **Lead Time for Changes**<br>How long it takes for a commit to go into production | Less than 1 day                          | Between 1 day and 1 week               | Between once per month and once every 6 months | More than 6 months           |
| **Mean Time to Recovery**<br>How long it takes to restore service from an interruption | Less than 1 hour                         | Less than 1 day                        | Between 1 day and 1 week                       | More than 6 months           |
| **Change Failure Rate**<br>The rate at which deployments cause production failures | 0% - 15%                                 | 16% - 30%                              | 16% - 30%                                      | 46% - 60%                    |

The performance gap between elite and low-performing teams is dramatic, with elite teams deploying **46x more frequently**, achieving **2,555x** faster lead times, and recovering from incidents **2,604x** faster while maintaining significantly **lower failure rates**.

> ##### The Cost of Low Performance

> Organizations with low-performing teams experience higher employee turnover, increased operational costs, slower time-to-market, and reduced customer satisfaction.
